/**
 * Watches the air for bonded devices and remembers when each was last heard.
 *
 * It does not decide anything -- it just keeps a fresh map of address to "seconds since I
 * last saw it", which the watcher polls each tick. Kept separate from the decision so the
 * decision stays pure and testable and this stays a thin wrapper over the platform scanner.
 *
 * The subtlety is address resolution. An iPad advertises under a rotating random address
 * that changes every fifteen minutes precisely so it cannot be tracked. Android's scanner
 * resolves that back to the device's identity address *only for bonded devices whose IRK it
 * holds* -- which is why the app pairs the iPad through system settings first, and why the
 * diagnostic screen exists to prove the resolution actually happens on this phone.
