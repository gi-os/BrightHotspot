/**
 * The decision, with no Android in it so it can be tested on the JVM.
 *
 * This is the whole "act like Instant Hotspot" behaviour reduced to a state machine that
 * takes one snapshot of the world at a time and answers with one action. The Android side
 * (WatchService) only gathers facts and obeys; every rule about *when* the hotspot should
 * come up or go down lives here, where it can be exercised without a phone.
 *
 * The problem it solves is that the phone cannot see whether the iPad has internet. So the
 * machine guesses -- iPad nearby and we are not on home Wi-Fi means "probably needs me" --
 * brings the access point up, and then lets the iPad answer the question by either joining
 * or not. A join confirms the guess. Three minutes of silence refutes it, and a refuted
 * guess earns a backoff so a cafe with good Wi-Fi does not make the phone flap.
